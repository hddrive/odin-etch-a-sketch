Etch-a-sketch

This is a web-based etch-a-sketch.
Hover the cursor over the main box and "pixels" will gradually get darker the more passes.
The grid size can be changed by clicking the button and entering an appropriate number. Clicking the button is the only way to reset
the "pixels".

This is a project from OdinProject I did for the course.
Completing it helped with learing DOM methods.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
